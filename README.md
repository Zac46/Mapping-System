# Mapping System

The galvanometer system is used for optical experiments requiring microfield scanning (such as local transmission spectrum measurements). It can achieve microfield scanning within an area of 20-30 µm, with a minimum step size for laser spot movement of approximately 0.05-0.06 µm (closer to 0.053 µm). The galvanometer motor has no significant backlash.

Scanning Shape: a rectangular area with length and width on the scale of tens of micrometers.
